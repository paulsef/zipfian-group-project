### WELCOME!!

This is just to get things up and running with the repo.

The search.py and business.py are python scripts to hit the Yelp api (forked 
from [another repo](https://github.com/Yelp/yelp-api/tree/master/v2/python).)

The results from the first ever api call are stored in first_call.json.
Fiddle around and see what you can do!
